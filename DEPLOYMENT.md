# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Web Deployment Guide

**This file is deprecated.** This project now focuses exclusively on the Jupyter notebook (`notebook.ipynb`).

For web deployment, please refer to the main README.md which contains instructions for running the Jupyter notebook locally.

## Current Project Focus

- **Jupyter Notebook Only**: `notebook.ipynb`
- **Local Execution**: Run the notebook locally with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- **No Web App**: The Streamlit web application has been removed from active development

## Running the Notebook

See `README.md` for instructions on:
- Installing dependencies
- Opening the notebook
- Running Monte Carlo simulations
- Viewing visualizations

## Legacy Files

The following files are kept for reference but are not actively maintained:
- `crypto_quant_liquidity_simulator.py` - Legacy Streamlit app
- `launch_app.py` - Legacy app launcher
- `run_chrome.bat` - Legacy batch file
- `Procfile` - Legacy deployment config
